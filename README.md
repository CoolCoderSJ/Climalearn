 An attempt to educate the general population on the devastating effects of climate change and help them understand what they can do to help stop these effects.

## Introduction
Climate change is a major issue in the world today. It is a global issue and affects everyone. Over the past few years, the world has started to experience a huge increase in temperature, and the effects of this increase are becoming more and more severe. The effects of climate change are not just the temperature, but also sea levels rising, and other environmental changes. The main reason for changes rising in severity is because the general population is not aware of the effects of climate change, or they choose to not do anything about it. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to educate the general population on the devastating effects of climate change and help them understand what they can do to help stop these effects.

## Resources
To make Climalearn as trustworthy as possible, I tried making all of my sources as trustworthy as possible as well. I have used the following resources to help me make this project:

- [NASA's NEX-DCP30 dataset from the Amazon Sustainibility Initiative (ASDI)](https://registry.opendata.aws/nasanex/) - Air temperature predictions until Dec 2099
- [NOAA's Sea Level trends](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/) - Embedded sea level trends map
- [NOAA's Ocean Service](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=Sea%20level%20along%20the%20U.S.,years%20(1920%20%2D%202020).) - Source for a fact
- [NASA's ECCO project](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-heat/) - Displaying the amount of heat in the ocean
